Font information for TeX Live on Cygwin
=======================================

Some of the texlive-collection-* packages provide fonts in
/usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/{opentype,truetype,type1}.  These fonts
can be made available to fontconfig, so that applications that rely on
fontconfig (xetex, emacs-X11,...) can use them.  This is *not* done by
default.

If you want the TeX Live fonts to be available to fontconfig, run the
script

    /usr/bin/texlive-enable-fontconfig

This only has to be done once; the TeX Live postinstall scripts will
then keep the font caches for these directories up to date when
texlive-collection-* packages are installed or updated.
