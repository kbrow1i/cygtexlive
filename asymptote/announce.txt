Subject: asymptote 2.38-2

The following package has been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* asymptote-2.38-2

Asymptote is a powerful descriptive vector graphics language for
technical drawing, inspired by MetaPost but with an improved C++-like
syntax. Asymptote provides for figures the same high-quality typesetting
that LaTeX does for scientific text.

This is a rebuild to remove the dependency on an obsolete gsl library.
