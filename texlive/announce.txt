TeX Live provides a comprehensive, cross-platform TeX system. It 
includes all the major TeX-related programs, macro packages, and fonts 
that are free software, including support for many languages around the 
world.

This release is a rebuild of the TeX Live 2017 binaries and supporting
libraries, patched to fix an upstream luatex bug.  See
