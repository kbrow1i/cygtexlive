TeX Live provides a comprehensive, cross-platform TeX system. It 
includes all the major TeX-related programs, macro packages, and fonts 
that are free software, including support for many languages around the 
world.  For more information, see

This is a rebuild of the TeX Live 2015 binaries and supporting
libraries, with a few small changes:

1. I am now able to build xindy on 64-bit Cygwin.

2. I have removed the call to fc-cache from the zp_texlive_finish.dash
postinstall script; this is no longer needed now that libfontconfig1
includes zp_fontconfig_cache_1.sh.

3. I have added to 0p_texlive_prep.dash support for the tlmgr (TeX
Live Manager) utility, which is going to be added to the upcoming test
release of the TeX Live collections.
